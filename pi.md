# Self-defense

After studying Linux actively for 2 months. I decided it was time to get some proper hands on experience, purchase a Raspberry Pi and set up my 
own personal VPN server at home. 

**First steps**
- After succesfully setting up my Ras-Pi and connecting it to my home network.
I ssh:d into it and downloaded the PiVPN software with the command `curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash`
- What is PiVPN you might ask?
    - "PiVPN is a set of shell scripts developed to easily turn your Raspberry Piâ„¢ into a VPN server using two free, open-source protocols:
      - Wireguard
      - OpenVPN"
    - More information on their website <https://www.pivpn.io>
- The PiVPN then ran an installation wizard to configure some basic setting like IP-addressing, hostnames, unattended upgrades, firewall, ports etc.

**Manual configurations**
